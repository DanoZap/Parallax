        <h2 class="section-title">The most massive objects</h2>
        <p>Most of the mass of our solar system resides in the Sun. It accounts for 99.89 percent. The second largest and most massive object is Jupiter. It is 318 times more massive than Earth and is 2.5 times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What are the planets of the solar system composed of?</h2>
        <p>The four smaller inner planets, also known as "terrestrial planets," are composed primarily of rock and metal. The four outer planets, also known as "gas giants," are substantially larger and more massive than the inner planets. Jupiter and Saturn are the largest and are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. The other two gas giants, Uranus and Neptune, are made of ice (water, ammonia and methane). Together they are known as the "ice giants".</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">A lot of distance</h2>
        <p>The distances in our solar system are also a noteworthy fact. The average distance between the Sun and the Earth is about 150 million km. On Saturn, the distance is about 10 times greater, reaching a whopping 1.5 billion kilometers. By the time we reach the dwarf planet Pluto, which lies in a region we call the Kuiper belt, we will be 6 billion kilometers from the center of the Sun.</p>
